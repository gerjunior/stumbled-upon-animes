# Stumbled Upon: Animes

## Description

As a Technical Support Representative (TSR) at CodePath, you are tasked with helping students in the community with their technical issues and questions for the courses they are enrolled in.

To help you understand the community's needs, TSRs are required to build the applications of each course they support. This is a great way to learn the material and empathize with the students.
